# m&a calculator!
While I was learning how to balance balance sheets and read/analyze financial statements for my CFI certificate in M&A Accounting and Purchase Price Allocation, I had to complete numerous excel templates built to help me learn each thing. After I felt confident in my ability to understand the math, I wanted to challenge myself to script it and automatically calculate it. There are two versions to this application:
- Terminal-Based: Fully functional.
  - This asks the user to input everything in command line and then spits everything back out.
- Web-Based: Not Functional: WIP
  - The web-based version is built using flask, and I hope to make it fully functional soon. My current issue is a lack of JavaScript knowledge, which I hope to learn during winter break when I have more time. Right now, I am more focused on working on **StockVision**, my predictive app for share pricing.
